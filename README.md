# file-archiver
This is a program that creates a malleable archive. The program has 4 main functions: adding/updating a file in the archive (with all its contents), extract a file from the archive to create a real file in the folder based on the archived version, delete a file from the archive, and print the archive out.

The inspiration from this project came from a class I didn't get to take, but seemed interesting to me at the time. It's functionality is seemingly simple, but it was difficult in that it forced me to work at a really low level. I wanted to take on a project that would challenge me and make me a better programmer. It's a few hundred lines (~700) of C code.
